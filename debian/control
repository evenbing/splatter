Description: Desktop bug tracker client for GNOME
 Splatter is a tool that can connect to multiple bug trackers on seperate
 platforms and execute complex queries and download bugreports and cache
 them locally for viewing and searching.

 Features:
  - Connects to bugzilla 3.4 using XML-RPC, and
  - Query bugs by product, people, severity, status, summary, comments and more.
  - Saves all bugs offline for faster and more efficient browsing.
  - Comment on bugs locally.
 
 Splatter is currently very early in development.
